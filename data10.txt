LINKIN PARK - NUMB. 
I'm tired of being what you want me to be, 
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface, 
Don't know what you're expecting of me, 
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes, 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertone), 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you, 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertone), 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there, 
Become so tired so much more aware, 
I'm becoming this all I want to do, 
Is be more like me and be less like you, 
Can't you see that you're smothering me, 
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control.
