Youthful yet so blind.
We held the greatest treasure.
Gave our hearts and sold our souls.
Convinced each other we'd last forever.
We had all the time in the world.
Yet we aged so soon.
Watching the cold steal, the love from our eyes.
Oh! how it's time.
Oh! how it's time.
I'm killing time while time slowly kills us.
We'll always wish we didn't waste away.. away the days.
We're wasting away.
When our hearts were young.
An our bodies were pure.
And there was fewer days gone by than to be had...
