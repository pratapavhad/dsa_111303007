The thing I think I love, 
Will surely bring me pain, 
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame. 
Three cheers for throwing up,  
Pubescent drama queen, 
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late. 

Kellin: 
(Scream) Until there's nothing left, 
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore, 
The thought of you is no fucking fun, 
You want a martyr I'll be one, 
Because enough's enough we're done. 

Vic:
You told me, "think about it", well I did, 
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore, 
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want, 
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor.
