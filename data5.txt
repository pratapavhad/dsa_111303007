The FSF maintains a list of "high priority projects" to which, 
the Foundation claims that "there is a vital need to draw the free software community's attention". 
The FSF considers these projects "important because computer users, 
are continually being seduced into using non-free software, 
because there is no adequate free replacement."
Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the Free Java implementations, 
GNU Classpath, and GNU Compiler for Java, 
which ensure compatibility for the Java part of OpenOffice.org, 
and the GNOME desktop environment.
The effort has been criticized for either not instigating active development,
or for being slow at the work being done,  
even after certain projects were added to the list.
The FSF maintains a "Respects Your Freedom hardware certification" program. 
To be granted certification, a product must use 100% Free Software, 
allow user installation of modified software, be free of back doors and conform with several other requirements.
