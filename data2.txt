Stephen Hawking has suggested that the absence of tourists from the future is an argument,
against the existence of time travel: this is a variant of the Fermi paradox. Of course, 
this would not prove that time travel is physically impossible, 
since it might be that time travel is physically possible but, 
that it is never developed (or is cautiously never used); and even if it were developed, 
Hawking notes elsewhere that time travel might only be possible, 
in a region of spacetime that is warped in the correct way, 
and that if we cannot create such a region until the future, 
then time travelers would not be able to travel back before that date, 
so "This picture would explain why we haven't been over run [sic] by tourists from the future.", 
This simply means that, until a time machine were actually to be invented, 
we would not be able to see time travelers. 
Carl Sagan also once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here, 
but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers, 
because bringing unintentional changes to the time-space continuum might bring about undesired outcomes to those travelers. It might also alter established past events.[26] There is also the possibility that if events were changed, we would never notice it because all events following and our memories would have been instantly altered to remain congruent with the newly established timeline.
