Up above the sea's grey flatland, wind is gathering the clouds,
In between the sea and clouds proudly soaring the Petrel, reminiscent of black lightning,
Glancing a wave with his wingtip, like an arrow dashing cloudward,
he cries out and the clouds hear his joy in the bird's cry of courage,
In this cry -- thirst for the tempest! Wrathful power, flame of passion,
certainty of being victorious the clouds hear in that bird's cry,
