W-type is not a dynamic typing app like others.
It lets you type, then checks the whole thing.

Use touch typing.
In Each type test you have to type minimum 50 % of the text, then only speed analysis will be done.
In Each type test, you have to have an accuracy of minimum 80%.

YOU MAY END TYPING IN BETWEEN, JUST ENSURE YOU HAVE TYPED 50%.
After you press enter on each line, the previous line cannot be accessed.
So, always make an habit, to check the current line for errors, fix them, and then move forward.

To end typing, press Ctrl + D on a NEWLINE.
ALWAYS REMEMBER, THE MORE YOU TYPE, MORE REAL OF YOUR SPEED IS REFLECTED.

For registered users, points are awarded as 80% speed + 20% accuracy.

Online sites  give small paragraphs, for type practising. However, such small texts
do not reflect our speed. Our speed is determined by for how long we can mantain that
, which also happens to be the criterion for Guiness world records.

ALL FAST TYPISTS WERE SLOW SOMEDAY....
Happy typing and Happy LInuxing...
