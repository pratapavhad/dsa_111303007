Up above the sea's grey flatland, wind is gathering the clouds,  
In between the sea and clouds proudly soaring the Petrel, reminiscent of black lightning,
Glancing a wave with his wingtip, like an arrow dashing cloudward, 
he cries out and the clouds hear his joy in the bird's cry of courage, 
In this cry -- thirst for the tempest! Wrathful power, flame of passion,  
certainty of being victorious the clouds hear in that bird's cry,  
Seagulls groan before the tempest, - groan, and race above the sea,  
and on its bottom they are ready to hide their fear of the storm. 
And the loons are also groaning, - they, the loons, they cannot access, 
the delight of life in battle: the noise of the clashes scares them, 
The dumb penguin shyly hiding his fat body in the crevice . It is only the proud Petrel, 
who soars ever bold and freely over the sea grey with sea foam!, 
Ever darker, clouds descending ever lower over the sea, 
,and the waves are singing, racing to the sky to meet the thunder, 
Thunder sounds. In foamy anger the waves groan, with wind in conflict, 
Now the wind firmly embraces flocks of waves and sends them crashing on the cliffs, 
in wild fury, smashing into dust and seaspray all these mountains of emerald.
